import { Display, Divider } from '@zeit-ui/react'

Hi!

I have decided to create my own humble place to start publishing some thoughts to.

"Why not on Medium?" you might ask. Well, for starters:

<Display caption="I don't tweet much, but when I do - I usually complain on something">

</Display>

I've been using Medium for a couple of years now, and it was ok, until one time Medium have introduced paywalls
and allowed ~~dumb~~ any people (majority of authors) to publish ~~dumb~~ any posts and get money for that
(like reposting some basic documentation sections for various programming languages), but this isn't the subject of this post.

### Technical details

Main packages:

- [`next.js`](#nextjs)
- [`next-mdx-enhanced`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced)
- [`@zeit-ui/react`](https://react.zeit-ui.co/)

#### next.js

I started looking at [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) simply out of curiosity,
I really liked the idea of [static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).
In combination with simplified routing - it works kinda well, it helps you to keep your project organized.
So this site is just an attempt to use next.js more deeply and what it's capable of with some real-life projects (I'll see how it goes).

#### next-mdx-enhanced

The reason I used `next-mdx-enhanced` and not [`with-mdx`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx) is simply
because the first is much more flexible (mostly for layouts). I spent too much time on `with-mdx` than I should have, while `next-mdx-enhanced`
began working right out of the box.

#### @zeit-ui/react

This UI package wasn't my first choice, but I decided to go with it because of its clean and neutral design.
If you think this design looks familiar - you're right, it's used by [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) site and dashboard.

My two other options were:

- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)
- [Primer React](https://primer.style/components/)

Material UI becomes second "Bootstrap" package, and sooner or later every second/third site will look the same with this design.

Primer React (GitHub UI) - turned out it looks great on GitHub itself, but for personal sites - not so much.

In conclusion, I decided to go full-vercel mode with next.js (project of vercel),
`@zeit-ui/react` (`zeit` is a former name of Vercel) and hosting on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).

#### Source code

I don't think anyone would care, but the source code of this site is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/Borales/borales.dev).
